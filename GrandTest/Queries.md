Perfect! Here's the **full set of SQL queries** to solve your tasks cleanly and correctly, assuming your database `customer_orders` and the mentioned tables have typical columns like `CustomerID`, `OrderID`, `OrderDate`, `Status`, `Quantity`, `Price`, etc.

---

# 1. **Total Revenue per Customer (Min 2 Orders, Exclude Cancelled Orders)**

```sql
USE customer_orders;

SELECT c.Name, SUM(oi.Quantity * p.Price) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
JOIN OrderItems oi ON o.OrderID = oi.OrderID
JOIN Products p ON oi.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE o.Status != 'Cancelled'
  AND o.OrderDate BETWEEN '2024-10-10' AND '2024-10-15'
GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.Name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT o.OrderID) >= 2;
```

---

# 2. **Customer with the Highest Average Order Cost**

```sql
USE customer_orders;

SELECT c.Name, AVG(oi.Quantity * p.Price) AS AvgCost
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
JOIN OrderItems oi ON o.OrderID = oi.OrderID
JOIN Products p ON oi.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE o.Status != 'Cancelled'
GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.Name
ORDER BY AvgCost DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

---

# 3. **Customer Who Ordered the Most Keyboards**

```sql
USE customer_orders;

SELECT c.Name, SUM(oi.Quantity) AS KeyboardCount
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
JOIN OrderItems oi ON o.OrderID = oi.OrderID
JOIN Products p ON oi.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE p.Name LIKE '%keyboard%'
GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.Name
ORDER BY KeyboardCount DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

---

# 4. **Products Ordered in Both 'Shipped' and 'Processing' but not 'Cancelled'**

```sql
USE customer_orders;

SELECT DISTINCT p.Name
FROM Products p
JOIN OrderItems oi ON p.ProductID = oi.ProductID
JOIN Orders o ON oi.OrderID = o.OrderID
WHERE o.Status IN ('Shipped', 'Processing')
  AND p.ProductID NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT p2.ProductID
    FROM Products p2
    JOIN OrderItems oi2 ON p2.ProductID = oi2.ProductID
    JOIN Orders o2 ON oi2.OrderID = o2.OrderID
    WHERE o2.Status = 'Cancelled'
)
GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.Name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT o.Status) = 2;
```

---

# 5. **Top 3 Most Expensive Products Never Ordered**

```sql
USE customer_orders;

SELECT p.Name, p.Price
FROM Products p
LEFT JOIN OrderItems oi ON p.ProductID = oi.ProductID
WHERE oi.ProductID IS NULL
ORDER BY p.Price DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

---

# 6. **Latest Order for Each Customer (Correlated Subquery)**

```sql
USE customer_orders;

SELECT o1.OrderID, o1.CustomerID, o1.OrderDate,
       (SELECT SUM(oi.Quantity * p.Price)
        FROM OrderItems oi
        JOIN Products p ON oi.ProductID = p.ProductID
        WHERE oi.OrderID = o1.OrderID) AS TotalCost
FROM Orders o1
WHERE o1.OrderDate = (
    SELECT MAX(o2.OrderDate)
    FROM Orders o2
    WHERE o2.CustomerID = o1.CustomerID
);
```

---

# 7. **Most Frequently Ordered Product**

```sql
USE customer_orders;

SELECT p.Name, SUM(oi.Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM Products p
JOIN OrderItems oi ON p.ProductID = oi.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.Name
ORDER BY TotalQuantity DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

---

# 8. **Orders Placed on Weekends**

```sql
USE customer_orders;

SELECT OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate
FROM Orders
WHERE DAYOFWEEK(OrderDate) IN (1, 7);
```

> ðŸ”¥ **Note:** In SQL `DAYOFWEEK()`:
> 
> - `1` = Sunday
>     
> - `7` = Saturday
>

# âœ… All Done!

Each query matches **your requested output columns and conditions**.
