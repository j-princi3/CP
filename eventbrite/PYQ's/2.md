2. Cached Requests
There are n services numbered from 1 to n in a system, and there are m requests to be processed. The service in which the iᵗʰ request 
is cached is denoted by cache[i], for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m. For any request, If the request is processed from its cached service, it takes 
1 unit of time. Otherwise, it takes 2 units of time.

Different services can process different requests simultaneously, but one service can only process one request at a time. Find the 
minimum time to process all the requests by allocating each request to a service.

Example
It is given that n = 3, m = 5, and cache = [1, 1, 3, 1, 1].
If the 1st, 2nd, and 4th requests are assigned to the 1st service, it will take 1 unit of time each, or 3 units of time to process 
them in total.
Assign the 3rd request to the 2nd service and the 5th request to the 3rd service. It takes 1 and 2 units of time to complete them, 
respectively. Therefore, all requests are processed in 3 units of time.

Function Description
Complete the function getMinTime in the editor below.

getMinTime has the following parameters:
	int n: the number of services in the system
	int cache[m]: the service in which the request is cached (of length m)

Returns
int: the minimum time required to process all requests

Constraints
1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10⁵
1 ≤ cache[i] ≤ n

Sample Case 0
Input
n = 4  
cache = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output
1

Explanation
Each request is cached in a different service. Process all of them at once, which takes 1 unit of time. 

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        // Read number of services n and number of requests m
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int m = sc.nextInt();
        int[] cache = new int[m];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            cache[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        sc.close();

        System.out.println(getMinTime(n, cache));
    }

    // Returns the minimum time to process all requests
    static int getMinTime(int n, int[] cache) {
        int m = cache.length;
        // Count how many requests are cached in each service
        int[] cnt = new int[n + 1];
        for (int s : cache) {
            cnt[s]++;
        }

        // Binary search on the answer T in [0 .. 2*m]
        int lo = 0, hi = 2 * m;
        while (lo < hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            if (canDoIn(mid, n, m, cnt)) {
                hi = mid;
            } else {
                lo = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return lo;
    }

    // Feasibility check: can we finish all m requests in time T?
    private static boolean canDoIn(int T, int n, int m, int[] cnt) {
        long servedOnCache = 0;
        long offloadCap = 0;

        for (int s = 1; s <= n; s++) {
            // Number of cached requests service s can serve in T time
            int useCache = Math.min(cnt[s], T);
            servedOnCache += useCache;

            // Remaining time slots on s can host off‑cache jobs (2 units each)
            int freeSlots = T - useCache;
            offloadCap += freeSlots / 2;
        }

        long overflow = m - servedOnCache;
        return offloadCap >= overflow;
    }
}
```
