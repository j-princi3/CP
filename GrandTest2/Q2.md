## Problem Description

You are provided with two inputs:

1. A string `s`, which is the text you are working on.
2. An array of strings `words`, which are the substrings you need to find in `s`.

Your task is to add HTML-like bold tags (`<b>` and `</b>`) around the parts of `s` that are exactly present in `words`. There are some rules to follow while adding these bold tags:

- If the substrings in `s` that match any of the `words` overlap, you should wrap this entire overlapped section in a single set of bold tags.
- If there are consecutive substrings already wrapped in bold tags, they need to be merged into a single set of bold tags.

Your goal is to return the modified string `s` with the appropriate bold tags added.

## Intuition

The intuition behind the solution is to efficiently identify all the substrings in `s` that match any of the words in `words` and then determine how to add bold tags around these substrings according to the specified rules.

To achieve this, a [Trie](https://algo.monster/problems/trie_intro) data structure can be utilized to store all the `words`. Trie is particularly useful for matching prefices of strings which is necessary since we are looking to find substrings in `s` that match any in `words`.

After populating the [Trie](https://algo.monster/problems/trie_intro) with all the `words`, we then iterate through each character in the string `s`, using the Trie to check for matches as we extend our current substring character by character. Each time we find a matching end of a word in `words`, we store this as a pair of indices marking the start and end of the bold tag.

Once we have all the index pairs, we need to merge overlapping ranges to comply with the given requirements. We initialize a new list that will hold the merged index ranges and iterate over the pairs, merging them if necessary.

Finally, we go through the merged index ranges, inserting the bold tags into the correct positions. We ensure that we only add non-bolded parts of `s` first, add an opening bold tag, append the bolded part, and then append a closing bold tag until all bolded ranges are processed.

The implementation uses a list to keep track of the modified string's parts and then joins them at the end to form the final result with the bold tags in place.

## Solution Approach

The solution consists of several steps, utilizing a [Trie](https://algo.monster/problems/trie_intro) data structure, list manipulation, and string manipulation. Below is an explanation of the implementation steps:

1. **Building the [Trie](https://algo.monster/problems/trie_intro):** The `Trie` class is defined, which has an `insert` method allowing us to insert a word into the Trie. Each node has a fixed size array of child pointers to cover all the possible ASCII characters (128 in this case). The `is_end` boolean indicates whether the path to the node represents the end of a word. We iterate over all the words and insert them into the Trie.
    
2. **Searching for Matching Substrings:** The `addBoldTag` function iterates over each character in the string `s`. It does this by fixing a start point and extending the end point character by character, checking if the current substring is in the [Trie](https://algo.monster/problems/trie_intro). If a match is found (signified by `is_end` being `True`), the indices (start, end) are added to the `pairs` list.
    
3. **Merging Overlapping and Consecutive Ranges:** Before wrapping substrings in bold tags, we first need to merge overlapping or consecutive index ranges. The `pairs` list containing start and end index pairs is iterated over, and if the current end index is greater than or equal to the start index of the next pair, the ranges are merged. This is achieved by updating the current end index to be the maximum of the current end index and the end index of the next pair.
    
4. **Building the Output String with Bold Tags:** The `ans` list will contain parts of the final string, including strings without bold tags and strings within bold tags. We iterate over the indices of the string `s`, checking against the merged index list `t`. If the current index `i` falls in a bolded range, we add the bold tags and the bolded substring to `ans`. If `i` is before the next bolded range, we add the non-bolded substring. This process continues until all characters have been processed or until the end of the `t` list is reached.
    
5. **Returning the Final Result:** Finally, we join all the parts in the `ans` list into a single string, which now contains the required bold tags, and return it.
    

The code is efficient since it identifies and processes overlaps in a single pass after [Trie](https://algo.monster/problems/trie_intro) construction, and building the string from the list of parts is done in `O(n)` time, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's use a small example to illustrate the solution approach.

Suppose we have the string `s`:

```
"abcxyz123"
```

And the array of strings `words`:

```
["abc","123"]
```

Here are the steps we would follow based on the solution approach:

1. **Building the Trie:** First, we create a Trie and insert the words "abc" and "123" into it. After this, our Trie will have two paths, one ending in 'c' and another ending in '3', each marked as the endpoint of a word.
    
2. **Searching for Matching Substrings:** We then iterate over each character in `s`. Starting at 'a', we look into the Trie and find that "abc" is a word that ends here. So, we add the pair (0, 2) to our list of pairs because the substring from the index 0 to index 2 matches a word in `words`. We perform similar checks for other indices and find that the substring "123" starts at index 6 and ends at index 8, so we add the pair (6,8) to our list.
    
3. **Merging Overlapping and Consecutive Ranges:** In this simple example, there are no overlapping or consecutive ranges in the `pairs` list. If there were, we would merge them into a single range. For illustration, if `words` also included "xyz", the pair list would be [(0, 2), (3, 5), (6, 8)], and we would merge (0, 2) and (3, 5) into (0, 5).
    
4. **Building the Output String with Bold Tags:** Next, we build the output string. We start from index 0, and since it's the start of a bold range, we insert `<b>` before "abc", and because (0, 2) marks the end of the bold segment, we insert `</b>` after "c". We do the same for the "123" substring starting at index 6 and insert `</b>` after "3".
    
5. **Returning the Final Result:** Lastly, we combine all parts together. After inserting the necessary bold tags, the resulting string parts are ["**abc**", "xyz", "**123**"]. We join these parts to get the final result: "**abc**xyz**123**".
    

The final output is a string with the substrings "abc" and "123" wrapped in bold tags since they match words from the `words` array. The sequence within the string has been kept, and tags have been appropriately placed without any overlaps or unnecessary tag insertions, following the described solution's approach.

## Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of building the Trie is `O(W * L)` where `W` is the number of words in the input list `words` and `L` is the maximum length of a word since we iterate through each character in every word.

For searching all the substrings in `s`, in the worst case, every substring starting from `i` to the end of `s` could be a potential match. This results in a time complexity of `O(N^2)` where `N` is the length of the string `s`.
