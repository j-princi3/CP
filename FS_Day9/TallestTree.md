In a forest, There are N redwoord trees in a row.
You are given the heights of the trees as heights[],

You are task is to find the longest tree arrangement as follows:
	- Minimum size of the tree arrangement is 3.
	- And there exist a Tree-'i' with heights[i], where 0 < i < N-1.
		- heights[0] < heights[1] < heights[2] <...< heights[i] and
		-  heights[i] > heights[i+1] > heights[i+2] >...>heights[N-1] 

And return the length of the longest tree arrangement.
If there is no such arrangement, return 0.
